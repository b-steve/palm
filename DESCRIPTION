Description: Functions to fit point process models using the Palm likelihood. First proposed by Tanaka, Ogata, and Stoyan (2008) <DOI:10.1002/bimj.200610339>, maximisation of the Palm likelihood can provide computationally efficient parameter estimation for point process models in situations where the full likelihood is intractable. This package is chiefly focused on Neyman-Scott point processes, but can also fit void processes. The development of this package was motivated by the analysis of capture-recapture surveys on which individuals cannot be identified---the data from which can conceptually be seen as a clustered point process. As such, some of the functions in this package are specifically for the estimation of cetacean density from two-camera aerial surveys.

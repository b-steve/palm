# palm

This package provides functions for the fitting of point process
models using the Palm likelihood function. Maximisation of the Palm
likelihood can provide computationally efficient parameter estimation
in situations where the full likelihood is intractable. This package
is chiefly focussed on Neyman-Scott point processes, but can also fit
void processes.

The development of this package was motivated by the analysis of
capture-recapture surveys on which individuals cannot be
identified---the data from which can conceptually be seen as a
clustered point process. Some of the functions in this package are
specifically for the estimation of cetacean density from two-camera
aerial surveys.

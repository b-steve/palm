Version 1.1.4
-------------

- Another bug fix for bootstrap simulations with no generated
  children.

- Removing spatstat dependency.

Version 1.1.3
-------------

- Minor change to one of the package's unit tests.

Version 1.1.2
-------------

- Implemented multipattern model fitting, so a single process can be
  fitted to multiple independent patterns.

- Minor bug fixes for void process fits.

Version 1.1.1
-------------

- Added the 'use.bobyqa' argument to fit.ns(), allowing optimisation
  via the bobyqa() function from the minqa package.

- Bug fix for bootstrap simulations with no generated children.

Version 1.1.0
-------------

- Added sim.twocamera() to simulate data from two-camera aerial
  surveys.

- Added the 'parents' argument to simulation functions, so that the
  user can specify their own parent locations.

- Added a component containing parent locations to the output of
  sim.ns().

- Bug fix for buffer edge correction with fit.twocamera().

- Bug fix for user-specified parameter bounds with fit.void().

Version 1.0.0
-------------

- First release of palm, after the original project was named 'nspp'.

- Includes functions to fit Neyman-Scott point processes (including
  Thomas process and Matern process variants) and void processes.

- Includes a function to estimate cetacean density from two-camera
  aerial surveys.

- Includes functions to simulate from all of the above models.
